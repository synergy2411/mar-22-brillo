# What is JavaScript?
- Used for validation
- Interactive web apps
- Create Single Page App - does not reload/refresh in browser
- Supported to DB - MongoDB
- Easy to learn
- Reduces Server interaction
- Defines behaviour of web page
- Interpreted as well as compiled
- Frontend (Client-side) as well as backend (Server-side)
- Game development
- Open Source/ need to take pre-caution to make it secure
- Versatile
- Single Threaded
- Asynchronous / Non blocking
- light-weight
- Event-Driven
- Dynamic
- Scripting Language
- Was based on Objects only



MEAN / MERN -> Full Stack 
MongoDB : JSON -> JavaScript Object Notation
Express : JavaScript Web App Framework
Angular/React : Client-side JS Library / Framework
Node : Platform -> JS - 25-30MB


# Async Tasks
- Timer API -> setTimeout, setImmediate, setInterval
- Read/Writing to/from file
- Obtaining the socket
- DB Connection
- Remote Server Call (XHR Call)
- Complex Calculation [1500] * [1500] -> 3-4S


# JavaScript Environments
- Browser Environment : Client-side, SpiderMonkey -> Opera & Safari, Chakra-> MS Edge, V8 engine -> Chrome
- Node Environment : Server-side -> V8 Engine


# Web Technologies
- HTML : presenting data
- CSS : change the appearence
- JavaScript : behaviour


# JavaScript Objects
- Unordered collection 
- denoted by { }
- consists of Property Key and value pair (key : value)
- Two properties are separated by Comma (,)
- Literal, Constructor, Instance


# Array -> collection of homogenous elements, based on index, ordered one.

# Datatypes in JavaScript
> Primitive Types : Number, String, Boolean
> Reference Types : Functions, Objects, Arrays, Date


# Functions in JavaScript
- first class citizens in JavaScript
- Syntax as well as Value

# Closures : process of binding the outer scope variable to the inner function


# JavaScript Engine Execution 

- Synchronous Tasks
- Asynchronous Tasks
    : Micro Tasks -> Promises and queueMicrotask()
    : Macro Tasks


# JavaScript Engine runs in two phases
- Creational Phase => allocates the memory
- Executional Phase => performs all assignements and executions

# ES6 / ES2015 - ECMA Community specifications
- arrow functions
- destructuring
- classes
- extends
- implments
- rest and spread operators
- template literals
- block scoping
- map / set
- promises


# Module System
- CommonJS > NodeJS App
- ES6 Module > Browsers
- AMD Module > Additional configuration


# Handling JavaScript Async behaviour-
- Callbacks
- Promise
- Observable API


# Node installer comes with -
-> Node Runtime Environment (V8 Engine execute JavaScript Code) > node fileName.js
-> Node Package Manager (npm) -> dependecy manager for NodeJS projects
-> Node Core Modules

# nodemon : restart the server automatically, whenever the file is saved
> npm install nodemon -g
> nodemon core-module.js




# What is NodeJS?
- Platform
- Fast
- Single Threaded
- Scalable 
- Open Source
- Asynchronous
- Event-driven
- Real-time App
- Data Intensive task
- Dynamic Web Apps

# Modules
- Core -> e.g file system, http, path, os etc
- File -> maths.js, fortune.js
- External -> colors, yargs etc


# package.json -> meta info about the project
> npm init [-y]
> npm i yargs colors

# Notes App
> node index.js add --title="New Title" --body="New Title Body"
> node index.js read --title="Some Title"
> node index.js remove --title="Some Title"
> node index.js list
